Setting up NFS Server
=====================
In a network, a machine which provides files and folders to
other devices on the network is known as a File Server.

Types of File Servers:
=====================

A)NFS
B)FTP (Now removed from Redhat Course)
c) Samba


NFS is a network filesystem used for Sharing files/folders over a network.
It is a platform dependant service which allows to transport data in between
Similar Operating Systems. (Works on Linux and UNIX servers)

It was introduced by SUN MicroSystems. 
It does NOT support Authentication 
In Centos7/RHEL7 NFS version 4 is used

                       Requirements of NFS Server
                        ==========================
A- Packages:           B- Service/Daemon:           C- Ports:           D-Debugging tools:
------------           ----------------             =========           ==================
1- nfs-utils*           1- nfs.server.service       2049 (NFS)             exportfs
2- rpc-bind*            2- rpc-bind.service         111 (Port Mapper)



Server Side Activity:
=====================

install the packages:
=================
yum install nfs-utils* rpcbind*


Edit /etc/exports:
-----------------
vi /etc/exports
/u01/share 192.168.56.103/24(rw,async)

:wq

#or
#/u01/share        * (rw,async)      

Activate the Services:
=====================

systemctl enable nfs-server.service
systemctl restart nfs-server.service

Open the firewall ports:
=======================

firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-service={rpc-bind,mountd,nfs}
firewall-cmd --reload



#run the command exportfs -rv to verify that the server is exporting the filesystem


On the Client:
=============
#yum install nfs-utils*

#showmount -e 192.168.56.103 #(to see the exported directory from the server)

Mount the NFS filesystem from the server to the client
#mount 192.168.56.103:/u01/share   /mnt/share

To permanently mount the filesystem on the client:

vi /etc/fstab
192.168.56.103:/u01/share /mnt/share nfs rw,sync,hard,intr,_netdev 0 0
