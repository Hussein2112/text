We are going to explain some of the most common errors
that confuse newcomers to linux

I- command not found
A- Above error message could appear if you are trying to run a 
   script/command and the directory of your script or command
   is not already defined in the PATH variable.
   Another possible reason for the error is that you might have mistyped the command.
   
   Possible Solutions:
   1- First confirm if your current directory is in your PATH variable.
      echo $PATH
      pwd
      Solution to this is to add your current directory to your path
      by editing your .bash_profile file and then source the profile. Example: "source ~/.bash_profile"
      then try your command again.

      or


   2- Simply Run the command/script using the full path (Absolute Path)
      Example: /home/james/script1.sh
               where script1.sh is the script you are trying to run
               and /home/james is where your script is located
   3-Run the command/script using a relative path
     Example: ./script1.sh
              ./ tells the shell to run the command/script from the current directory.

B- Another reason might be that you mistyped the command
   and therefore the command you typed actually doesn't exist


II- Permission denied

a- The user running the command/script does NOT have execute permission 
   for the command/script
   run the command
   ls -l <commandname>
   to verify the permission issue.
   also, run the following command to verify your current user.
   whoami
