Setting up NFS Server
=====================
In a network, a machine which provides files and folders to
other devices on the network is known as a File Server.

Types of File Servers:
=====================

A)NFS
B)FTP (Now removed from Redhat Course)
c) Samba


NFS is a network filesystem used for Sharing files/folders over a network.
It is a platform dependant service which allows to transport data in between
Similar Operating Systems. (Works on Linux and UNIX servers)

It was introduced by SUN MicroSystems. 
It does NOT support Authentication 
In Centos7/RHEL7 NFS version 4 is used

In this document, we are going to describe how to set up an NFS server and one NFS client.
In this example, the server IP address is 192.168.27.5
Your Server IP will most likely be different.



                       Requirements of NFS Server
                        ==========================
Here are the four different things you need on your NFS Server.

A- Packages:           B- Service/Daemon:           C- Ports:           D-Debugging tools:
------------           ----------------             =========           ==================
1- nfs-utils*          1- nfs.server.service       2049 (NFS)             exportfs
2- rpcbind*            2- rpc-bind.service         111 (Port Mapper)



Server Side Activity:
=====================

install the packages:
=================
yum install nfs-utils* rpcbind*


Edit /etc/exports:
-----------------
mkdir /share
vi /etc/exports



/share        *(rw,async,no_root_squash)      
 :wq!
#Make sure the * is next to the ( like *(, otherwise file will get mounted as readonly. * stands for all clients

Activate the Services:
=====================

systemctl enable nfs-server.service
systemctl restart nfs-server.service

Open the firewall ports:
=======================

firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-service={rpc-bind,mountd,nfs}
firewall-cmd --reload



#run the command exportfs -rv to verify that the server is exporting the filesystem


On the Client:
=============
#yum install nfs-utils*
#apt install nfs-client*   for ubuntu ... tested on Linux Mint
#showmount -e YOURSERVERIP #(to see the exported directory from the server)

Mount the NFS filesystem from the server to the client
#mkdir /client   #Create this directory on the Client machine

mount YOURSERVERIP:/share   /client
#df -h  (To confirm that the directory from your server got mounted)

To permanently mount the filesystem on the client:

vi /etc/fstab
YOURSERVERIP:/share /client nfs defaults 0 0
#mount -a
#df -h  (To confirm that the directory from your server got mounted)
